# Vienna: Client side MVC framework for Opal

Until a better README is out (shame on us) you can take a look at the Opal implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

[opal/opal-todos](https://github.com/opal/opal-todos)

## Model

```ruby
class Book < Vienna::Model
  attribute :title
  attribute :author
end
```
